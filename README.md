<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Manapool, battle the Dark as a wizard surviving a magic dystopian city in this 2D isometric, souls-like, bullet hell. 

- Explore and fight through a level of enemies who drop Moonlight, the soulslike currency in the city.
- The wizard can carry a melee weapon and have memorized spells for their journey, both viable on their own but can be interweaved in combat. All the while, balancing health, mana used to cast magic and stamina. (Two ranged spells, two AOE spells equipped at all times. Melee attacks and dashing cost stamina, which recovers shortly after an attack or dodge. Successive melee attacks regain small amounts of mana).
- Levels are linear but can offer a more challenging or hidden path that reward (or punish) the player for taking.
- Enemies placed throughout the level provide challenge and Moonlight when defeated.
- Players rest at Manapools under the magic granting moonlight. Restores the players health and mana. Players can fast travel to other manapools, swap out equipped spells and use Moonlight to upgrade spells, weapons and wizard stats.
- Levels end in bosses, operating like a bullet hell with magic and like a souls like as the boss attacks players with melee.
- The wizard can dash to avoid attacks. (Holding to extent or tap for quick dash, allowing precise movement for the player).
- The wizard must weave their magic casting and melee attacking into their evasive movement to survive and purge the Dark.
- When the wizard dies, he drops all his Moonlight and respawns at their last Manapool. They can retrieve it or lose it if they fail to before they die again.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I'm going to use this to explain architecture and organization in hopes that good foundations can make for an easily scalable game. This stuff is tentative; open to additions, improvements and refactoring, need be.

### Spells

Spells are structured in a hierarchy of inheritance, layed out at such:

- SpellParent
  - RangedSpell
    - Firebolt...
  - AOESpell
    - Whirlpool...

Each Spell has an associated SpellEffect, which is the actual projectile that is spawned when the spell is cast.

### Modular Stat Components

The Health, Mana and Stamina Components can got on any entity in any combination. You can overwrite their values in the inspector, but currently, these components look to their parent script (such as Player or Enemy, to determine and overwrite their attributes)

### Hitbox and Hurtboxes

Hitboxes collide with Hurtboxes to register damage. Pass a HealthComponent into a Hurtboxes inspector variable to connect them,

There is a third hitbox: SpellHitbox. Used for SpellEffects, they have two additional variables: is_players (Checked upon collision with a Hurtbox to negate frendly spell damage) and destroy_on hit (I hope, self explanatory).

### Globals

- SpellManager = Manages the spells the Ppayer has discovered, equipped and casts
- StatManager = Useless rn but may be needed to better UI implementation and/or stat upgrades for the player

<!-- PULLING -->
## Downloading the Project

1. Create a folder in your Godot project directory; whereever you want to store the game

2. https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

3. Import the project into Godot and you're set

Up to you if you want to fork off onto other branches, just remember to oull before working and push when you've made enough progress. If we run into merge errors, we can try sorting it out but ultimately it would be easier if we kept our workflow linear. We can communicate when we'll be working and when we've pushed.
